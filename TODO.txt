For final version:
  - merge improved-setup & fancy-eval into master
  - compile SUBMISSION and benchmark vs player-tc6 + Dvonner + player3
  - submit!

Maybe later:
 - validate all code!
     - print it out, verify, add comments...
 - consider auto-learning for evaluation parameters?
   See: http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/forum/topic2.jsp?forum=30&topic=19
   Note: it seems this is what Dvonner did!

Overall:
 - improve placement phase evaluation function
 - improve stacking phase evaluation function
 - improve move ordering heuristic:
    - to evaluate: take a random sample of positions, rank possible moves by
      value, and see which ones tend to be good?
 - optimize time budgeting for moves
