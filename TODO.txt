Note for after test competition 4:
 - Timing code has changed yet again. check if the online judge is still 70~90ms
   behind my expected time. If not, up the time limit to e.g. 4.95 or so.

For next competition:
  - do another big test with Dvonner, Holtz and player3 from caia
  - remove `pass' as dfs() parameter? (are there positions where we benefit from it?)

For final version:
  - replace range checks like (r >= 0 && r < H) with ((unsigned)r <= H)
    and nonsense like this.
  - change compile.pl to #define NDEBUG so assertions are not tested anymore?

Later:
 - better handling of 'exact' values; if these are stored in the tt, their depth
   should be considered infinite.
 - consider move representation:
    - maybe ints instead of chars is more efficient?
    - change library functions so single moves are passed by value?
    (how to benchmark these changes when evaluation takes most time?)
Maybe later:
 - include principal variation in AI result.
 - consider implementing NegaScout? (should work well with killer heuristic?)
 - consider implementing  MTD(f)? (tricky with float values)
 - make board hashing for TT more efficient, if possible.
 - check hash table performance:
     - how often do collisions occur?
     - how full is the table when they happen?
     - reconsider replacement policy (replace if depth >= tt->depth only?)
 - try to optimize time budget for moves
 - validate all code!
     - print it out, verify, add comments...
 - consider auto-learning for evaluation parameters?
   See: http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/forum/topic2.jsp?forum=30&topic=19
   Note: this is what Dvonner did!
 - test against Rororobot and Jan's Program on littlegolem.net

Overall:
 - improve placement phase evaluation function
 - improve stacking phase evaluation function
 - improve move ordering heuristic:
    - to evaluate: take a random sample of positions, rank possible moves by
      value, and see which ones tend to be good?
 - benchmark code, find bottlenecks, fix them.

Test suite:
 - transposition table tests: check values for various positions with and
   without tt, and ensure their values are equal.
 - collect various positions; benchmark and validate player with different
   techniques enabled?
