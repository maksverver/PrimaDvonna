Soon (for testcompetition):
 - improve evaluation function for placing: stones with less then 3 open/opponent
   neighbours are bad! (leads to edge pieces which can only jump to own pieces)
 - try move-reordering to make alpha-beta pruning more efficient

Later:
 - test program to validate distance functions/
   fix distance function in Dvonn-tool and JavaScript game code!
 - allow transposition table/move reordering be enabled/disabled
   on the command line for easier testing
 - make board hashing for TT more efficient

Long time:
 - improve evaluation functions for both algorithms

Test suite:
 - transposition table tests: check values for various positions with and
   without tt, and ensure their values are equal.

Later:
 - make TT and move ordering (runtime/compiletime?) optional
 - consider auto-learning for evaluation parameters?
