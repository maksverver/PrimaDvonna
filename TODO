 - transposition table?
 - think of a name!

Maybe:
 - implement placement as regular moves? (major overhaul!)
 - better set-up phase:

Later:
 - improve evaluation function
 - implement iterative deepening/time-limited solving
 - try move-reordering to make alpha-beta pruning more efficient
 - better evaluation function: auto-learning?
