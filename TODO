 - allow transposition table/move reordering be enabled/disabled on the command line
 - make board hashing for TT more efficient
 - improve setup function (recent changes aren't very good!
   (reintroduce summed distance to Dvonns)
 - improve evaluation function (how?!)
 - try move-reordering to make alpha-beta pruning more efficient
 - implement iterative deepening/time-limited solving

Test suite:
 - transposition table tests: check values for various positions with and without
   tt, and ensure their values are equal.

Later:
 - make TT and move ordering (runtime/compiletime?) optional
 - consider auto-learning for evaluation parameters?
