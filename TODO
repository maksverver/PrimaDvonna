Note:
 - timing reports don't really seem to match up with what the CodeCup server thinks :/

Later:
 - "killer heuristic" instead of move ordering?
 - make board hashing for TT more efficient
 - optimize move reordering: currently I apply move reordering when depth >= 3,
   and subtract 2 from search depth compared to regular search. Maybe these
   values can be optimized/tweaked further. How to evaluate?!
 - optimize time budget for moves
 - implement MTD(f)
 - validate all code!
 - consider auto-learning for evaluation parameters?
   See: http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/forum/topic2.jsp?forum=30&topic=19

Long time:
 - improve evaluation functions for both algorithms

Test suite:
 - transposition table tests: check values for various positions with and
   without tt, and ensure their values are equal.
