 - holistic approach to move selection (regardless of game phase) 
 - improve set-up phase: symmetric placement makes little sense in practice
 - improve evaluation function:
    - remove bonus for possession of stacks early in the game.

Later:
 - extend transposition table to store intermediate positions
 - implement iterative deepening/time-limited solving
 - try move-reordering to make alpha-beta pruning more efficient
 - consider auto-learning for evaluation parameters?
