Friday:
 - think of a name!
 - upload to CodeCup

Maybe:
 - implement placement as regular moves? (major overhaul!)

Later:
 - extend transposition table to store intermediate positions
 - improve evaluation function
 - improve set-up phase
 - implement iterative deepening/time-limited solving
 - try move-reordering to make alpha-beta pruning more efficient
 - consider auto-learning for evaluation parameters?
