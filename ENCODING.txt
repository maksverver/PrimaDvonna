are comments or metadata and should be ignored. Other lines contain
space-separated moves in standard format, in the order they are played.

STATE DESCRIPTION
-----------------
A state is described as a sequence of 50 digits in base 62, which are encoded
with characters from the following 62-character sequence:
    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789
(This is a standard Base64 encoding without the two non-standard characters.)

Digit 0 is encoded as 2*phase + player, where:
  phase = 0 for placing pieces or 1 for stacking pieces;
  player = 0 for white or 1 for black.

Digit 1 through 49 describe the fields of the board in row-major order, one
digit per field, with each field encoded as:
  0 if it is empty;
  1 if it contains just a Dvonn piece;
  n otherwise, where n = 4*pieces + 2*dvonn + player - 2, where:
    player = 0 for white or 1 for black;
    dvonn  = 0 if the stack contains no Dvonn piece, 1 otherwise;
    pieces = the number of pieces in the stack.

A state description gives a representation of an intermediate state. It is
formatted as: "<moves>:<board>" where <moves> is the number of moves played
(a decimal integer without leading zeroes) and <board> is a 49-character string
describing the fields of the board, one character per field in row-major order.

Note that dvonn = 1 even if the stack contains more than one Dvonn piece and
pieces is the total number of pieces in the stack (including white, black and
Dvonn pieces). This encoding limits stacks to a maximum height of 15, which is
insufficient for all possible states, but states with very high stacks occur
rarely in practice.
